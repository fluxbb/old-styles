# FluxBB: Old Styles

In version 1.6, the "traditional" styles from the old PunBB days were removed from FluxBB's default install.

To keep them archived (and possibly alive), they will now live here.
In addition, they are still available for download from the [styles repository on FluxBB.org](https://fluxbb.org/resources/styles).

## Available styles

- Cobalt
- Lithium
- Mercury
- Oxygen (FluxBB's old default style)
- Radium
- Sulfur
- Technetium (The winner of the [1.4 style competition](https://fluxbb.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=3967))
